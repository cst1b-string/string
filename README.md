# Fullstack Template

This is a fullstack template for a monorepo using [PNPM](https://pnpm.js.org/),
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Directory Structure

This template is organized into four directories:

- [`apps/`](apps/README.md)
- [`packages/`](packages/README.md)
- [`services/`](services/README.md)
- [`tools/`](tools/README.md)

You can read more about each directory in their respective `README.md` files.

## Tooling

The template comes pre-setup with a couple of useful tools:

- [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) for linting commit messages
- [eslint](https://eslint.org/) for linting and enforcing code style for JavaScript and TypeScript
- [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) for running linters on staged files
- [prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting
- [turbo](https://turbo.build/) for monorepo management and build pipelining

All of these tools are well-documented and can be configured to your liking.
